When writing in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. After that, comes the part that converts this Markdown file in a HTML or a document ready to print, which happens when using a *Markdown application* capable of processing the file. There are a lot of applications available, one in particular, Dillinger, convert the Markdown formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in all web browsers.
